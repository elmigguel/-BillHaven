## SUCCESS METRICS: WHAT VCs WANT TO SEE

### Crypto VCs (Paradigm, Polychain, a16z):
- Protocol design (smart contract architecture)
- Token economics (BILL token for escrow staking?)
- Multi-chain strategy (Ethereum, Solana, TON)
- Developer activity (GitHub stars, forks)

### Fintech VCs (Index, Ribbit, Finch):
- Transaction volume (monthly GMV)
- Merchant adoption (# of billers)
- User growth (MAU, retention)
- Unit economics (take rate, CAC, LTV)

### Dutch VCs (Finch, Prosus, Golden Egg):
- MiCA compliance status (AFM license)
- EU market penetration (Netherlands → EU)
- Regulatory moat (first-mover advantage)
- Local partnerships (Dutch banks, ecosystem)

---

## THE NETHERLANDS ADVANTAGE (USE THIS IN EVERY PITCH)

### Three Bullets to Memorize:
1. **"Netherlands leads EU crypto compliance - 90%+ MiCA-compliant in Q1 2025"**
2. **"AFM license = instant access to 27 EU countries (regulatory passport)"**
3. **"EU trading volumes jumped 70% post-MiCA - we're positioned perfectly"**

### Why This Matters:
- VCs see regulatory clarity = lower risk
- First-mover MiCA advantage = competitive moat
- Netherlands = next Adyen/Wise origin story
