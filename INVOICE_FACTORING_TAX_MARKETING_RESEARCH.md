### 4.3 FAQ Entries

**Q: Can I use BillHaven transactions for tax purposes?**

A: BillHaven provides comprehensive documentation for every transaction, including Purchase Agreements, Transfer Certificates, and annual Tax Summaries. This documentation is designed to meet professional standards for financial record-keeping.

However, BillHaven is a technology platform, not a tax advisor. Whether a specific transaction qualifies as a tax-deductible business expense depends on your individual circumstances, business structure, and local tax laws.

We strongly recommend consulting with a qualified tax professional (such as a CPA or licensed tax advisor) to understand how BillHaven transactions may apply to your specific tax situation.

A: Every invoice factoring transaction on BillHaven includes:

1. **Purchase Agreement:** Legal contract documenting the sale/purchase of the invoice
2. **Transfer Certificate:** Proof that ownership of the invoice has transferred from seller to buyer
3. **Tax Summary:** Annual report of all your BillHaven transactions, organized by category

These documents are provided for your convenience and record-keeping. They follow industry standards used by traditional invoice factoring platforms.

---

**Q: Are invoice factoring fees tax-deductible?**

A: BillHaven cannot provide tax advice. However, we can share general information:

In many jurisdictions, invoice factoring fees paid by businesses are treated as ordinary business financing costs, which may be deductible. The specific tax treatment depends on:
- Your business structure (sole proprietor, LLC, corporation, etc.)
- Your jurisdiction (USA, EU, UK, etc.)
- Your overall tax situation
- Current tax laws (which change frequently)

BillHaven provides the documentation that traditional invoice factoring platforms provide. Whether this results in tax deductions for your specific situation should be determined by a qualified tax professional.
