These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

Oracle/Maker)\n * - Payment method-based hold periods (prevents chargebacks)\n * - Velocity limits (prevents fraud scaling)\n * - Progressive trust system (NEW_USER -> ELITE)\n * - Oracle signature verification for payment webhooks\n * - Role-based access control (ADMIN, ARBITRATOR, ORACLE)\n *\n * PAYMENT FLOW:\n * 1. Bill Maker creates bill and locks crypto\n * 2. Payer claims the bill on-chain\n * 3. Payer pays fiat off-chain (bank/iDEAL/PayPal)\n * 4. Payer marks payment sent (confirmPaymentSent)\n * 5. Oracle verifies payment via webhook (verifyPaymentReceived) OR\n *    Bill Maker confirms manually (makerConfirmPayment)\n * 6. Hold period countdown starts\n * 7. After hold period: auto-release OR maker can skip hold\n * 8. Crypto released to Payer, fee to platform\n */\ncontract BillHavenEscrowV3 is ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, AccessControl {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\n    using

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms.

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

Bill Maker creates bill and locks crypto\n 2. Payer claims the bill on-chain\n 3. Payer pays fiat off-chain (bank/iDEAL/PayPal)\n 4. Payer marks payment sent (confirmPaymentSent)\n 5.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless it's overridden.
