## Tax Compliance Summary

### Key Findings

**Invoice Factoring Fees ARE Tax-Deductible (B2B Context):**
- IRS Section 162: "Ordinary and necessary business expenses"
- Factoring fees = financing costs (like interest)
- Deductible in year incurred
- Requires professional documentation

### 4 Critical Disclaimers Implemented

1. "Not tax advice - consult a tax professional"
2. "Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction"
3. "Documentation for your records only"
4. "Seek professional guidance for your specific situation"

### Where Disclaimers Appear

- **Layout.jsx Footer:** Professional tax disclaimer banner
- **Terms.jsx Section 10:** Tax Responsibilities & Documentation
- **Home.jsx:** Subtle compliant marketing ("Professional Records")
- **invoiceFactoringService.js:** All 4 generated documents include disclaimers

### Compliant Marketing Strategy

**DON'T Say:**
- ❌ "Save on taxes with invoice factoring!"
- ❌ "Deduct your bills as business expenses!"
- ❌ "Tax-free bill payments!"

**DO Say:**
- ✅ "Professional documentation provided for your records"
- ✅ "Consult your accountant about potential deductions"
- ✅ "Comprehensive tax summaries generated"
