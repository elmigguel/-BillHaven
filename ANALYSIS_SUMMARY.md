   - Instant settlement
   - Competitors don't have this

   - Configurable per chain (12 ETH, 128 Polygon, etc.)
   - Competitors use fixed confirmation counts

3. **Progressive Trust System** - ADVANCED
   - NO TRANSACTION LIMITS (security via verification)
   - Dynamic holds (14 days → 24 hours)
   - Competitors have fixed limits ($10K-$50K)

4. **Code Quality** - EXCELLENT
   - 40/40 smart contract tests passing
   - Clean, modular architecture
   - Consistent error handling

5. **Chain Coverage** - COMPETITIVE
   - 11 chains + Lightning
   - More EVM chains than most competitors
   - TON integration (unique)

### ⚠️ GAPS (What's Missing)

**Critical Gaps (Easy to Fix):**
1. DAI stablecoin (30 min fix)
2. Avalanche (2 hours)
3. zkSync Era (2 hours)
4. RPC fallbacks (4 hours) - reliability issue
5. USD price oracle (8 hours) - UX improvement

**Strategic Gaps (Acceptable):**
1. Fewer altcoins (100+ vs. our ~15) - INTENTIONAL
2. Fewer payment methods (1000 vs. our ~10) - ACCEPTABLE

## COMPETITIVE SCORES

| Platform | Security | Coverage | Innovation | Total |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| BillHaven | 95/100 | 85/100 | 95/100 | 79.4/100 |
| Binance P2P | 85/100 | 90/100 | 70/100 | 89.4/100 |
| OKX P2P | 85/100 | 80/100 | 70/100 | 85.6/100 |
| Bybit P2P | 85/100 | 80/100 | 70/100 | 85.0/100 |

**Note:** BillHaven's lower total is due to:
- New platform (no liquidity yet) - 40/100
- 1% fee vs. 0% competitors - 70/100

These will improve over time as liquidity builds.

**Strengths outweigh weaknesses** in target market segment.
